# üêæ FileWatchDog

**FileWatchDog** is a Bash-based system utility I wrote during my learning journey.  
It helps manage system logs and perform basic network checks all from one interactive menu.  

it's easy to use and easy to edit if you want to add another functions you can do it easly.
i designed it for non-technical and technical people 
and for the network functions i tried to use simple commands that easy to read its output like whois command, etc

Remember to change the file premission :

chmod +x filewatchdog.sh

Run the command :

sudo ./filewatchdog.sh

or 
sudo bash filewatchdog

it is good to run the script as sudor just to make sure that everything going to be working without any errors
or any premission denaid messages 

- This is one of my **first Bash projects**, built step by step as part of my learning so maybe the tool it's self doesn't make any since
  but i'm rtying to build something usefull with the knowlage that i have
    
- It‚Äôs under a **public license** ‚Üí free for anyone to use and improve.  
- I plan to add more features in the future (like automated scheduling, monitoring, and log analysis).
